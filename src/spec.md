# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a paranormal investigation service website where users can submit cases, view a gallery of reported phenomena, and access investigation resources.

**Planned changes:**
- Build home page with hero section, team introduction, services overview, and contact information
- Implement case submission form with location, phenomena type, description, contact details, and photo upload
- Create case gallery page with filtering by phenomena type and location
- Build backend data models and storage for paranormal cases with investigation status tracking
- Create investigation resources page covering phenomena types, equipment, documentation guidelines, and safety
- Apply mysterious atmospheric design with dark color scheme (deep purples, midnight blues, ethereal greens) and vintage investigation aesthetics
- Include generated paranormal-themed hero background and team logo as static assets

**User-visible outcome:** Users can explore the paranormal investigation service, submit reports of paranormal activity with photos, browse submitted cases filtered by type and location, and access educational resources about paranormal phenomena and investigation methods—all in an atmospheric, mystery-themed interface.
