  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all requirements with comprehensive frontend and backend functionality. The paranormal investigation website includes all requested pages (home, case submission, gallery, detail view, resources), full backend data models with filtering capabilities, and a dark atmospheric design theme. However, the diff shows a critical issue: the actual generated image files are not present in the diff, only references to them in the code.",
